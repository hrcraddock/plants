## Poppies: An Oscillating Symbol
Poppies are known by many names: *papaver somniferum* (the opium poppy), *papaver rhoeas*, *papaver hortense* (common poppy), *papaver somniferum laciniatum* (feather poppies). The opium poppy has a long history of man-made cultivation and coevolution. Originally used and revered by humans medicinally and religiously in the Middle East, the opium poppy became an object of aesthetic beauty in Europe, and was later racialized through the Opium Wars in the nineteenth century. As a recreational drug, opium has been a tool for artistic inspiration, but also an addictive substance which has warranted attempts at wholesale eradication of poppy cultivation. Today, opium poppies are still grown for their flowers, but are firmly associated with corruption due to their role in the illegal drug industry in South America and Afghanistan, where the poppies are mass-produced for their seed capsules which hold the drug opium. This condemnation of the opium poppy occurred after centuries of shifting attitudes towards the plant, oscillating between a symbol of beauty and a blight on civilizations in different spaces, time periods, and cultural contexts. Over time, the globalized identity of the poppy changed rapidly, dependent on human-imposed values and its changing functions in different cultures.

## Prehistory of the Poppy
Though the use of opium rapidly spread during the 15th and 16th centuries, opium poppies were not always able to live and thrive in just any environments. Poppies, like most other plants known today, were domesticated and coevolved to meet the needs of human beings. It is not known where poppies are native, as the first mention of poppies were as cultivated plants. Salavert et al (2020) confirms that poppy seed remains were initially found in Neolithic sites in "the central and Western Mediterranean, northwestern temperate Europe, and the Western Alps."

In the 16th century, opium poppies could be found in books about “hardy flowers” or existing in “wild gardens.” In [*The Wild Garden; Or, Our Groves & Shrubberies Made Beautiful by the Naturalization of Hardy Exotic Plants*](https://books.google.com/books?id=1IdaAAAAYAAJ&newbks=0&dq=wild%20gardens%20%20william%20robinson&pg=PA51&output=embed) (1870), author and practicing gardener William Robinson described *Papaver somniferum* as able to “grow[ing] in any soil.” However, the spread of the poppy itself needed careful monitoring via human intervention in order to naturalize and exist in differing environments, specifically outside of the Mediterranean temperate zones.[^ref2]

## Divine Remedies
 
Like most plants used for hallucinogenic effects, opium poppies were first used for ritual and sacrifice purposes. Presence of opium poppies has been detected as early as the Paleolithic Era. Both seed deposits and representations of the opium poppy seed pods were found in artifacts from western Europe, more specifically the Mediterranean and parts of what is now the Middle East. Many artifacts with representations of the seed pods were found in Greece, Crete, Cyprus, Egypt, Palestine, and Syria. Poppy seed capsules were precious, magical, and even divine. The poppy flower had yet to make much of an entrance until the Roman empire, when barley and poppy were both associated with “Persephone and the promise of perpetual rebirth,” the Minoan goddess of poppies, and Demeter/Isis, goddess of agriculture.

## New Geographies and Meanings
 
During the Holy Inquisition, use of anything related to the East was banned including the use of the opium poppy. From the 12th to the 15th century, western Europe opposed any Eastern influence. Meanwhile, India, the Middle East, and China participated in the naturalization of the opium poppy. Arab traders are thought to have spread the opium poppy to Tang Dynasty China, where opium was integrated into various medicinal concoctions and dietary recipes. [^ref5] Integration of opium poppies into diet and medicine originated in Southern China and its countryside, where Buddhist monasteries often concocted remedies for ailments related to the throat and stomach and spread recipes to rural neighborhoods. Despite 17th century European writings promotoing the hardiness of the poppy plant, in 1061 Su Song writes that, “[Poppies] are hard to cultivate. They must be planted during the ninth month, in a piece of land which was manured the year before. If not cultivated in this way, it will never germinate.” [^ref6]

Century after century, social perceptions of the opium poppy changed drastically, despite being useful as a medicinal drug throughout history. In the 13th century Paracelsus, a physician and scholar, repopularized the opium poppy as the drug “laudanum,” thus western societies continued their use of the opium poppy as medicine. Meanwhile, both Asia and the Middle East took part in opium trading during Europe's ban on eastern products. Dutch sailors who smoked opium were considered “primitive people” for partaking. [^ref7] In the 19th century, author and naturalist George Birdwood writes of Indian opium as, “the luxury of the rich in China, as champagne is in Europe and America." Asian and Middle Eastern use of the morphine content in opium via smoking distinguished opium use from western use of opium with pills and tinctures.

## Rebranding: From Value in Aesthetics to a Household Drug

While prehistoric and ancient depictions of opium poppies mostly referred to seed capsules and the dried seed heads of poppies, poppies themselves gained notoriety in the 16th and 17th centuries in aesthetic as flowers, especially in botanical illustration, floral arrangements, and other artwork. Illustrations of wild poppies, double red poppies, common poppies, feathery poppies or annual poppies, were common. During the Early Modern Era, poppies gained notoriety as beautiful objects rather than functional tools.[^ref8]

Italian doctor, chemist, and promoter of chemical remedies Angelo Sala discusses the medicinal properties of opium and evaluates existing knowledge about its effects in his 1618 *Opiologia; or a Treatise concerning ... Opium*, primarily its ability to "wonderfully and speedily release the body from intolerable pains". The first chapter is preceded by an image entitled ‘the method of extracting the juice of the poppy’, shown here, depicting a Turkish opium picker using his knife to scratch the poppy seed capsule in order to collect the sap. A similar image, shown behind Sala’s image here, appears on the title page of Georg Wolfgang Wedel's *Opiologia* (1682).

The opium poppy was given the name *papaver somniferum* by Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in his [*Species Plantarum*](https://archive.org/details/speciesplantarum00clin_857/page/508/mode/2up?q=papaver) (1753), the genus coming from the noun for poppy in Greek and the species name acknowledging its sleep and dream-inducing properties in the etymological link to the latin *somnium*. This name differentiates the opium poppy from other varieties of annual flowering plant in the family Papaveraceae.

The nineteenth century saw a conflict between existing conceptions of the opium poppy as a plant of beauty which provided relief and inspiration and increasingly negative attitudes towards the morality of the trade and use of the drug, with the oppositional western and eastern perceptions increasingly overlapping. Nineteenth century herbals such as the physician Hermann Adolph Köhler's [*Medizinal-Pflanzen*](https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/303420) (1890) continued to categorize the opium poppy as a medicinal plant. Often referred to during this period as laudanum, a tincture of opium with wine or water, the relieving effects of opium in medical terms remained well-known and opium was used in commonplace medicines, even for children, to the extent that it was referred to as "the poor child’s nurse" due to its ability to stop babies crying.

## War and Colonialism

The opium poppy’s role within the political conflicts of empire, trade, and regulation in the nineteenth century is epitomized in The Opium Wars (1839-1842 and 1856-1860). Connecting the opium poppy to another primary economic plant of the period, tea, the trade imbalance between Britain and China, with China accepting only silver in exchange for tea, formed the conflict which led to the opium wars. The British response was to illegally smuggle Indian opium into China for payment in silver. Fraught discussions of the ‘Opium Question’ centered on the morality of the trade in light of the addictive properties of the drug, as well as the financial dependence on opium. An 1882 edition of the [*Journal of the Society of Arts*](https://archive.org/details/journalofsociety30soci_0/page/200/mode/2up) records a discussion of this: "there was a very painful impression on the minds of some persons as to the morality of this trade [...] many believed that this country [Britain] was not only importing on a large scale a pernicious drug into the most populous country of the world, but also compelling its introduction and use by force of arms."

This question of morality was heightened by the use of British India to fuel this drug trade. The East India Company managed opium poppy plantations across India, but sold off the product to private merchants to transport to China, increasingly disconnecting the opium poppy plant from the drug product it provided.[^ref9]

Archival records held at The Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew display the role of the institution in this colonial network of trade, describing "Experimental Poppy Gardens" in India, which sought to examine methods of poppy cultivation, including diseases and soil conditions impacting the plants and the yield of opium they produced.[^ref10] The opium poppy was considered a "useful plant", and a whole volume entitled "India: Economic Products: Opium" is dedicated to it in the Miscellaneous Reports of Kew, which record activities in the network of botanical gardens across the British Empire. As an ‘economic product’ of financial value whose cultivation was regulated by the East India Company, it is clear that the opium poppy was of interest in the context of colonial economic botany in the nineteenth century.

Joseph Hooker, later director of Kew Gardens between 1865 and 1885, visited the opium manufactory in Patna in India in 1848. In his [*Himalayan Journals*](https://www.google.co.uk/books/edition/Himalayan_Journals/sCYKAQAAIAAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1&printsec=frontcover) Hooker gives an account of the process of cultivation and labor intensive methods of extraction, from the granting of licenses from the East India Company, the flowering of the poppies in late January and early February, the extraction of latex from the seed pods in February and March, the transportation of the opium jars to stores, and the creation of "balls" of opium by men working "ten hours a day" to be sent to market.

## Literary Inspiration, Dreams, and Addiction

While Britain waged war with China over the trade of the opium poppy’s valuable drug product, within Britain itself, opium’s reputation as a source of artistic inspiration and creative dreams grew to influence the work of many poets of the Romantic period. Samuel Taylor Coleridge  described his poem [*Kubla Khan*](https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=aMkNAAAAQAAJ&newbks=0&dq=christabel&pg=PA52) as "a fragment [...] composed in a sort of Reverie brought on by two grains of opium". Recording similar experiences of the inspirational effect of opium, Thomas De Quincey writes in his [*Confessions of an English Opium Eater*](https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=POREAAAAYAAJ&newbks=0&pg=PA3) (1821) that "[i]f opium-eating be a sensual pleasure, [...] I am bound to confess that I have indulged in it to an excess, not yet recorded of any other man". The poppy is also explicitly associated with femininity in J. J. Grandeville’s [*Les Fleurs Animées*](https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/309170) [The Flowers Personified] (1847), which includes an image of a poppy humanized in the form of a woman sprinkling poppy seeds from the seedpods onto insects.

Later in the century, opium continued to play a role both in the inspiration and content of literary works. "A novel written about an experiment with opium written under the influence of opium", Wilkie Collins’s *The Moonstone* (1868) centers on a mysterious theft unknowingly performed while sleepwalking under the influence of opium and Collins’s own opium addiction reflects that of his character Ezra Jennings.[^ref11] 
<param ve-iframe

Opium is alluded to, mentioned, and used in the works of a variety of other prominent Victorian novelists, including Charles Dickens ([*Oliver Twist*](https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Vz8JAAAAQAAJ&newbks=0&pg=RA2-PA72)), Jules Verne ([*Around the World in Eighty Days*](https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=oqw5AQAAIAAJ&newbks=0&dq=around%20the%20world%20in%2080%20days%20book&pg=PA144)), Bram Stoker ([*Dracula*](https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=3BoZEAAAQBAJ&newbks=0&lpg=PP1&pg=PT193)), and Arthur Conan Doyle ([*Sherlock Holmes*](https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=3BoZEAAAQBAJ&newbks=0&lpg=PP1&pg=PT193)).

## Decadence, Degeneration, and Racism
       
However, as opium became entwined with the indulgence and decadence of the fin de siècle, the drug was also increasingly being associated with racist concepts of degeneration. In his book [*Degeneration*](https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=9yWihGl1EFUC&newbks=0&pg=PA34) (1895), Max Nordau writes of the impact of addiction to such substances as opium on the development of societies, suggesting that "[a] race which is regularly addicted, even without excess, to narcotics and stimulants in any form (such as […] opium) […] begets degenerate descendants". The opium poppy became intertwined with international wars and racialised concerns about harmful addiction, forewarning of the sharp downturn of its reputation in the twentieth century. Yet the opium poppy continued to be depicted as a flower of beauty, not always directly associated with the drug it produced; Marianne North (1830-1890), a botanical artist whose extensive paintings are displayed in the gallery she built in the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, painted the [opium poppy](https://artuk.org/discover/artworks/foliage-flowers-and-seed-vessel-of-the-opium-poppy-87954/search/keyword:marianne-opium--referrer:global-search) with emphasis on a seedpod in the foreground, unscarred and untouched.

The nineteenth century opened and closed with significant developments in the production of medicinal and recreational substances from the opium poppy. Morphine, the first drug isolated from the plant, was first produced in 1804, while 1895 saw the first commercial production of heroin from chemically processed morphine by German pharmaceutical company Bayer, who named it thus because it was seen to have "heroic effects" on users.[^ref12] With the peak in opium production occurring around the early twentieth century, the trade came under greater global scrutiny. The International Opium Convention in 1912 led to a worldwide ban on trading opium, morphine and cocaine, and since then morphine and some other opiates have remained in use as pain relievers, but continue to be illegal for recreational use.

## The Cursed Flower in Colombia

Throughout the twentieth century, the poppy trade and trafficking and smuggling routes became a global business with producers in Asia and Latin America: The Golden Crescent (Afghanistan, Iran and Pakistan), The Golden Triangle (Burma, Thailand, Laos and Vietnam) and in the Americas, Colombia and Mexico. These regions of the world where most of the world's poppies are produced are also places which, despite their differences, share certain political, social, economic and environmental particularities: good climate and perfect land for production, constant war, political instability, paramilitary personnel, inequality, among other reasons. To illustrate in more depth what the presence of opium poppy has meant in a specific case, we chose to talk about Colombia, and the way in which this plant has generated a clear political, social, economic, and environmental effects for human and non-humans communities. 

At the end of the 20th century in Colombia, the opium poppy went from being an unknown plant to a metaphor for beauty, the hidden and the forbidden, as well as for consumption, excess and precariousness. Once it flourishes in the mountain ranges, the seeds spread avidly in humid and tropical forest. The plant grows, reproduces and becomes an object of desire for its precious "honey", as the peasants call the latex that oozes from its fruit. This same plant that has been admired for its beauty suddenly transforms and begins to be called “the cursed flower” (La flor maldita). Strangely, after its flower fades, the capsule emerges as a sign of a fortune that needs to be revealed.

In a photograph by a contemporary colombian artist Juan Fernando Herrán from 2000, we see the precise moment when the head of the poppy has been delicately cut off, and liquid surges from it. In this artwork, the presence of the plant is transformed into a powerful image that distances itself from certain previous visual representations; on the contrary, the photograph shows the opium poppy capsule as a question between the human and the vegetal, the visual and the sensorial, the material and the spiritual.

## Policing, Farmers, Eradication

 
The spread of poppy crops in Colombia was a social and economic phenomenon, especially for small farmers who saw it as a unique opportunity to cultivate and trade a plant that had been recently introduced into the country. This rapid acceleration of trafficking and consumption of heroin also resulted in the emergence of policies to persecute and exterminate the plant. This resulted in a constant fear spread throughout the homes of peasants and indigenous peoples, who they did most of the opium planting in remote places and on small farms. [^ref14] In the same decade, the Colombian government signed with the United States the Plan Colombia, a political and economic initiative whose mission was to eradicate illicit crops such as cocaine, marijuana, and opium poppy from the country. The exponential increase in poppy cultivation put the country at the top of the world's poppy producers and Colombian heroin became sought after in the foreign market due to its high purity level. In this scenario, the government began a campaign of strong police persecution of both the plant and the people who cultivated it. The eradication was done through the work of many people who dug it up manually and, on the other hand, an intense and ineffective aerial eradication with glyphosate, a potent herbicide. In this state of emergency, the police and the military went after the plant and arrested whomever they oversaw taking care of it. Uncertainty and paranoia seemed to be in the air all the time. The government created a battleground that translated into a metaphor for a vigilante state.

Juan Fernando Herrán himself, in his series "papaver somniferum", presents a work entitled "judicial triptych" (tríptico judicial) that evidences this police practice around the plant. In this "installation" he appropriates a photograph that circulated during those years in one of the most important newspapers in Bogota. The image in the center shows two peasants who have been caught. In this case, as it happens with a certain visuality as a police device, the offenders are presented with what they have been arrested for. A table with a delicate tablecloth displays, almost stretching from side to side, a large bouquet of opium poppies. On one side of the table, almost imperceptibly, we can see two blades and two containers can be seen, proof that the two men are guilty even before their trial.

This delicate staging is doubly displayed by the artist who adds two "natural" capsules, one on each side of the image. The two works, both the photograph and the capsules, are manipulated; the artist himself carefully composes the scene and places these two capsules as two portraits that dialogue with the photograph, almost like a traditional triptych in which each of the parts composes a story. The artist himself conceives the scratching action on each of the capsules as the inscription of a "promise": That promise that comes from the plant itself. It is a promise that is to come and at the same time that is being cut off. The plant itself is a promise of a better future for certain impoverished communities, but it quickly becomes in its opposite as a sign of deception, an injustice, and displacement.

## Displacement and Environmental Terror

The displacement of peasants and indigenous people was considerably accentuated during the war against the "cursed flower". Entire populations had to flee due to police persecution and the structures of the drug production; for some scholars, displacement should not be understood as an effect but as a weapon of war, a capitalist strategy of accumulation in which both the state and the insurgent groups empty land as a reason to expropriate, to appropriate both the territories and their resources. The truth is that, in these politics of domination, the whole landscape was being transformed. Not only was violence being wrought on the human, but also on the plant and the other organisms that coexisted with the opium poppy. The aerial spraying fell from the air and reached every corner of the surface. Those Edenic scenes of an almost virginal landscape of the mountains began to change into a codified space where the machine with its noise and its poison began to become an integral part of that new colonizing gaze. [^ref15]

Carlos Uribe's (1999) work entitled Horizons with Glyphosate (Horizonte con glifosato) makes direct reference to these political and environmental issues that were amid a broad public and private debate about the increasingly notorious presence of drug money in Colombian society. The work is a quotation and an extension of a 1913 painting of the same name made by Antonio Cano, already considered emblematic for regional visuality in Colombia. On the one hand, Cano shows a peasant family extending their hand in an act of promise in front of the immensity of a territory that as an act of creation needs to be occupied. The religious, patriarchal and dominion over the territory allusions made the work an unsurpassable example of a certain identity that was beginning to be defined and defended in the region of Antioquia in Colombia, one of the most prosperous and richest regions of the country and at the same time one of the most violent and most marked by drug trafficking. On the other hand, in Uribe's work, in addition to making an artistic appropriation, he also makes a historical reference to an environmental situation that was happening once the airplanes spilled glyphosate.

Curiously, the eyes of the pilots had to direct their gazes to the beauty of the opium poppy flower. Wherever they saw red, they had to spray. The plant becomes a translatable sign of its own precariousness and a threat to the vegetation that covers or hides it. Different reports from both the state and organizations warned of the consequences of aerial spraying for both humans and the environment. Artist Maria Elvira Escallon displays the encounter between landscape and herbicide. For 26 days she takes pictures to demonstrate visually the slow and damaging effect of the glyphosate. The art pieces reveal how the opium poppy relates into a small and big scale. The two works of art, both Uribe's and Escallón's, question the relationship that the plant has with the construction of life and of death, with the intimate, the public and the private. The opium poppy becomes an allegory and accumulation of that which is criminal and immoral. Even today we cannot consider the history of Colombia without understanding the agency of these plants, including the opium poppy, and their relationship with the environment, the animals, and the human.
