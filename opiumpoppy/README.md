## Prehistoric-16th Century
Though the use of opium rapidly spread during the 15th and 16th centuries, opium poppies weren’t always able to live and thrive in just any environments. Poppies, like most other plants known today, were domesticated and coevolved to meet the needs of human beings. It is not known where poppies are native, as the first mention of poppies were as cultivated plants. In the 16th century, opium poppies could be found in books about “hardy flowers” or existing in “wild gardens.” Author and practicing gardener William Robinson described Papaver somniferum as able to “grow[ing] in any soil.” However, the spread of the poppy itself needed careful monitoring via human intervention in order to naturalize and exist in differing environments, specifically outside of the Mediterranean temperate zones.

## Early Modern Poppies

The opium poppy was given the name papaver somniferum by Linnaeus in his [Species Plantarum](https://archive.org/details/speciesplantarum00clin_857/page/508/mode/2up?q=papaver)(1753), the genus coming from the noun for poppy in Greek and the species name acknowledging its sleep and dream-inducing properties in the etymological link to the latin somnium. Angelo Sala’s 1618 Opiologia; or a Treatise concerning ... Opium discusses the medicinal properties of opium and evaluates existing knowledge about its effects, primarily its ability to ‘wonderfully and speedily release the body from intolerable pains’. The first chapter is preceded by an image entitled ‘the method of extracting the juice of the poppy’, depicting a Turkish opium picker using his knife to scratch the poppy seed capsule in order to collect the sap. A similar image appears on the title page of Georg Wolfgang Wedel's Opiologia (1682).

## 19th Century: A Household Drug 

The nineteenth century saw a conflict between existing conceptions of the opium poppy as a plant of beauty which provided relief and inspiration and increasingly negative attitudes towards the morality of the trade and use of the drug. Nineteenth century herbals such as Köhler's [*Medizinal-Pflanzen*](https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/303420) (1890) continued to categorize the opium poppy as a medicinal plant. Often referred to during this period as laudanum, a tincture of opium with wine or water, the relieving effects of opium in medical terms remained well-known and opium was used in commonplace medicines, even for children, to the extent that it was referred to as ‘the poor child’s nurse’ due to its ability to stop babies crying.

## War and Colonialism

The Opium Wars (1839-1841 and 1856-1860) situate the opium poppy within the political conflicts of empire, trade, and regulation in the nineteenth century. Connecting the opium poppy to another primary economic plant of the period, tea, the trade imbalance between Britain and China, with China accepting only silver in exchange for tea, formed the conflict which led to the opium wars. The British response was to illegally smuggle Indian opium into China for payment in silver. Fraught discussions of the ‘Opium Question’ centered on the morality of the trade in light of the addictive properties of the drug, as well as the financial dependence on opium. An 1882 edition of the Journal of the Society of Arts records a discussion of this: ‘there was a very painful impression on the minds of some persons as to the morality of this trade [...] many believed that this country [Britain] was not only importing on a large scale a pernicious drug into the most populous country of the world, but also compelling its introduction and use by force of arms.’

This question of morality was heightened by the use of British India to fuel this drug trade. The East India Company managed opium poppy plantations across India, but sold off the product in to private merchants to transport to China, increasingly disconnecting the opium poppy plant from the drug product it provided. [^ref1] The cultivation of poppies in the nineteenth matches the development of vast global networks of plant transfers, and archival records at Kew describe affiliated experimental plots growing opium poppies in India. These ‘Experimental Poppy Gardens’ sought to examine methods of poppy cultivation, including diseases and soil conditions impacting the plants and the yield of opium they produced. The opium poppy was considered a ‘useful plant’, and a whole volume in the Miscellaneous Reports of Kew is dedicated to it: ‘India: Economic Products: Opium’. This categorisation as an ‘economic product’ and the regulation of opium poppy cultivation by the East India Company situates the plant within the context of colonial economic botany in the nineteenth century; as a plant which produced a product of economic value, the opium poppy is given attention in this collection which records the work of colonial botany in Kew’s network of gardens across the British Empire.

Joseph Hooker, later director of Kew Gardens between 1865 and 1885, visited the opium manufactory in Patna in India in 1848 and returned with a series of illustrations displaying the processes of cultivating and manufacturing opium. He gives an account of the process of cultivation and labour intensive methods of extraction, from the granting of licenses from the East India Company, the flowering of the poppies in late January and early February, the extraction of latex from the seed pods in February and March, the transportation of the opium jars to stores, and the creation of ‘balls’ of opium by men working ‘ten hours a day’ to be sent to market.

## Literary Inspiration, Dreams, and Addiction

Opium’s reputation as a source of artistic inspiration and creative dreams became intertwined with the work of many poets of the Romantic period. Opium played a role both in the inspiration and content of nineteenth century literature. Samuel Taylor Coleridge wrote in his preface to the poem fragment Kubla Khan, of an ‘anodyne […] from the effects of which he fell asleep’, and during this sleep ‘he has the most vivid confidence, that he could not have composed less than from two to three hundred lines’. On awakening, Coleridge wrote the lines of Kubla Khan. Recording this inspirational effect of opium, Thomas De Quincey writes in his Confessions of an English Opium Eater (1821) that ‘If opium-eating be a sensual pleasure, [...] I am bound to confess that I have indulged in it to an excess, not yet recorded of any other man’. The poppy also took on gendered associations in J. J. Grandeville’s Les Fleurs Animées [The Flowers Personified] (1847), which includes an image of a poppy humanized in the form of a woman sprinkling poppy seeds from the seedpods on insects.

Later in the century, opium played a role both in the inspiration and content of literary works: ‘a novel written about an experiment with opium written under the influence of opium’, Wilkie Collins’s The Moonstone (1868) centres on a mysterious theft unknowingly performed while under the influence of opium and Collins’s own opium addiction reflects that of his character Ezra Jennings. Opium is used in the works of a variety of prominent Victorian novelists, including Charles Dickens (Oliver Twist), Jules Verne (Around the World in Eighty Days), Bram Stoker (Dracula), and Arthur Conan Doyle (Sherlock Holmes). In Frank Baum’s The Wonderful Wizard of Oz (1900), the scent of opium poppies puts Dorothy to sleep in the chapter entitled ‘The Deadly Poppy Field’, while in the in the film the Wicked Witch of the West describes both the beauty and the threat of the poppy: ‘And now my beauties, something with poison in it I think, with poison in it, but attractive to the eye and soothing to the smell, poppies, poppies, poppies will put them to sleep.’
                              
## Decadence, Degeneration, and Racism

In the late nineteenth century opium was deeply entwined with the indulgence and decadence of the fin-de-siecle. In the 1890s, opium was increasingly associated with racist concepts of degeneration. In his Degeneration (1895), Max Nordau writes of the impact of addiction to such substances as opium on the development of societies, suggesting that ‘A race which is regularly addicted, even without excess, to narcotics and stimulants in any form (such as […] opium) […] begets degenerate descendants’. However, he adds that the West ‘need not concern ourselves about that, since the chief sufferers from them are Eastern peoples, who play no part in the intellectual development of the white races.’ 
                              
                              
## Practice Samples

Papaver somniferum, commonly known as the opium poppy or breadseed poppy, is a species of flowering plant in the family Papaveraceae. It is the species of plant from which both opium and poppy seeds are derived and is also a valuable ornamental plant, grown in gardens. Its native range is probably the eastern Mediterranean, but is now obscured by ancient introductions and cultivation, being naturalized across much of Europe and Asia.

The native range of opium poppy is probably the Eastern Mediterranean, but extensive cultivation and introduction of the species throughout Europe since ancient times have obscured its origin. It has escaped from cultivation, or has been introduced and become naturalized extensively in all regions of the British Isles, particularly in the south and east and in almost all other countries of the world with suitable, temperate climates.

A poppy is a flowering plant in the subfamily Papaveroideae of the family Papaveraceae. Poppies are herbaceous plants, often grown for their colourful flowers. One species of poppy, Papaver somniferum, is the source of the narcotic drug opium which contains powerful medicinal alkaloids such as morphine and has been used since ancient times as an analgesic and narcotic medicinal and recreational drug. It also produces edible seeds. Following the trench warfare in the poppy fields of Flanders, Belgium during World War I, poppies have become a symbol of remembrance of soldiers who have died during wartime, especially in the UK, US, and Canada.
