## Prehistoric-16th Century
Though the use of opium rapidly spread during the 15th and 16th centuries, opium poppies weren’t always able to live and thrive in just any environments. Poppies, like most other plants known today, were domesticated and coevolved to meet the needs of human beings. It is not known where poppies are native, as the first mention of poppies were as cultivated plants. In the 16th century, opium poppies could be found in books about “hardy flowers” or existing in “wild gardens.” Author and practicing gardener William Robinson described Papaver somniferum as able to “grow[ing] in any soil.” However, the spread of the poppy itself needed careful monitoring via human intervention in order to naturalize and exist in differing environments, specifically outside of the Mediterranean temperate zones.

## Early Modern Poppies

The opium poppy was given the name papaver somniferum by Linnaeus in his [*Species Plantarum*](https://archive.org/details/speciesplantarum00clin_857/page/508/mode/2up?q=papaver)(1753), the genus coming from the noun for poppy in Greek and the species name acknowledging its sleep and dream-inducing properties in the etymological link to the latin somnium. Angelo Sala’s 1618 *Opiologia; or a Treatise concerning ... Opium* discusses the medicinal properties of opium and evaluates existing knowledge about its effects, primarily its ability to ‘wonderfully and speedily release the body from intolerable pains’. The first chapter is preceded by an image entitled ‘the method of extracting the juice of the poppy’, depicting a Turkish opium picker using his knife to scratch the poppy seed capsule in order to collect the sap. A similar image appears on the title page of Georg Wolfgang Wedel's *Opiologia* (1682).

## 19th Century: A Household Drug 

The nineteenth century saw a conflict between existing conceptions of the opium poppy as a plant of beauty which provided relief and inspiration and increasingly negative attitudes towards the morality of the trade and use of the drug. Nineteenth century herbals such as Hermann Adolph Köhler's [*Medizinal-Pflanzen*](https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/303420) (1890) continued to categorize the opium poppy as a medicinal plant. Often referred to during this period as laudanum, a tincture of opium with wine or water, the relieving effects of opium in medical terms remained well-known and opium was used in commonplace medicines, even for children, to the extent that it was referred to as ‘the poor child’s nurse’ due to its ability to stop babies crying.

## War and Colonialism

The Opium Wars (1839-1841 and 1856-1860) situate the opium poppy within the political conflicts of empire, trade, and regulation in the nineteenth century. Connecting the opium poppy to another primary economic plant of the period, tea, the trade imbalance between Britain and China, with China accepting only silver in exchange for tea, formed the conflict which led to the opium wars. The British response was to illegally smuggle Indian opium into China for payment in silver. Fraught discussions of the ‘Opium Question’ centered on the morality of the trade in light of the addictive properties of the drug, as well as the financial dependence on opium. An 1882 edition of the [*Journal of the Society of Arts*](https://archive.org/details/journalofsociety30soci_0/page/200/mode/2up)  records a discussion of this: ‘there was a very painful impression on the minds of some persons as to the morality of this trade [...] many believed that this country [Britain] was not only importing on a large scale a pernicious drug into the most populous country of the world, but also compelling its introduction and use by force of arms.’

This question of morality was heightened by the use of British India to fuel this drug trade. The East India Company managed opium poppy plantations across India, but sold off the product in to private merchants to transport to China, increasingly disconnecting the opium poppy plant from the drug product it provided. [^ref1] Archival records at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew describe ‘Experimental Poppy Gardens’ in India, which sought to examine methods of poppy cultivation, including diseases and soil conditions impacting the plants and the yield of opium they produced.[^ref2] The opium poppy was considered a ‘useful plant’, and a whole volume entitled ‘India: Economic Products: Opium’ is dedicated to it in the Miscellaneous Reports of Kew, which record activities in the network of botanical gardens across the British Empire. As an ‘economic product’ of financial value whose cultivation was regulated by the East India Company, it is clear that the opium poppy was of interest in the context of colonial economic botany in the nineteenth century.

Joseph Hooker, later director of Kew Gardens between 1865 and 1885, visited the opium manufactory in Patna in India in 1848 and returned with a series of illustrations displaying the processes of cultivating and manufacturing opium. In his [*Himalayan Journals*](https://www.google.co.uk/books/edition/Himalayan_Journals/sCYKAQAAIAAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1&printsec=frontcover) Hooker gives an account of the process of cultivation and labour intensive methods of extraction, from the granting of licenses from the East India Company, the flowering of the poppies in late January and early February, the extraction of latex from the seed pods in February and March, the transportation of the opium jars to stores, and the creation of ‘balls’ of opium by men working ‘ten hours a day’ to be sent to market.

## Literary Inspiration, Dreams, and Addiction

Opium’s reputation as a source of artistic inspiration and creative dreams influenced the work of many poets of the Romantic period. Samuel Taylor Coleridge wrote in his preface to the poem fragment [*Kubla Khan*](https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=aMkNAAAAQAAJ&newbks=0&dq=christabel&pg=PA52)), of an ‘anodyne […] from the effects of which he fell asleep’, and during this sleep ‘he has the most vivid confidence, that he could not have composed less than from two to three hundred lines’. On awakening, Coleridge wrote the lines of Kubla Khan. Recording this inspirational effect of opium, Thomas De Quincey writes in his [*Confessions of an English Opium Eater*](https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=POREAAAAYAAJ&newbks=0&pg=PA3) (1821) that ‘If opium-eating be a sensual pleasure, [...] I am bound to confess that I have indulged in it to an excess, not yet recorded of any other man’. The poppy is also explicitly associated with femininity in J. J. Grandeville’s [*Les Fleurs Animées*](https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/309170) [The Flowers Personified] (1847), which includes an image of a poppy humanized in the form of a woman sprinkling poppy seeds from the seedpods on insects.

Later in the century, opium played a role both in the inspiration and content of literary works. ‘A novel written about an experiment with opium written under the influence of opium’, Wilkie Collins’s *The Moonstone* (1868) centers on a mysterious theft unknowingly performed while under the influence of opium and Collins’s own opium addiction reflects that of his character Ezra Jennings. Opium is alluded to, mentioned, and used in the works of a variety of other prominent Victorian novelists, including Charles Dickens ([*Oliver Twist*](https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Vz8JAAAAQAAJ&newbks=0&pg=RA2-PA72)), Jules Verne (*Around the World in Eighty Days*), Bram Stoker (*Dracula*), and Arthur Conan Doyle (*Sherlock Holmes*). In Frank Baum’s *The Wonderful Wizard of Oz* (1900), the scent of opium poppies puts Dorothy to sleep in the chapter entitled ‘The Deadly Poppy Field’, while in the in the film the Wicked Witch of the West describes both the beauty and the threat of the poppy: ‘And now my beauties, something with poison in it I think, with poison in it, but attractive to the eye and soothing to the smell, poppies, poppies, poppies will put them to sleep.’
                              
## Decadence, Degeneration, and Racism

In the late nineteenth century opium was deeply entwined with the indulgence and decadence of the fin-de-siecle. In the 1890s, opium was increasingly associated with racist concepts of degeneration. In his [*Degeneration*](https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=9yWihGl1EFUC&newbks=0&pg=PA34) (1895), Max Nordau writes of the impact of addiction to such substances as opium on the development of societies, suggesting that ‘A race which is regularly addicted, even without excess, to narcotics and stimulants in any form (such as […] opium) […] begets degenerate descendants’. However, he adds that the West ‘need not concern ourselves about that, since the chief sufferers from them are Eastern peoples, who play no part in the intellectual development of the white races.’ The nineteenth century saw the opium poppy become intertwined with international wars, and racialised concerns about harmful addiction, forewarning of the sharp downturn of its reputation in the twentieth century. Yet the opium poppy continued to be depicted as a flower of beauty, not always directly associated with the drug it produced; Marianne North (1830-1890), a botanical artist whose extensive paintings are displayed in the gallery she built in the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, painted the [opium poppy](https://artuk.org/discover/artworks/foliage-flowers-and-seed-vessel-of-the-opium-poppy-87954/search/keyword:marianne-opium--referrer:global-search) with emphasis on a seedpod in the foreground, unscarred and untouched.

## The Cursed Flower in Colombia

At the end of the 20th century in Colombia, the opium poppy went from being an unknown plant to a metaphor for beauty, the hidden and the forbidden, as well as for consumption, excess and precariousness. Once it flourishes in the mountain ranges, the seeds spread avidly in humid and tropical forest. The plant grows, reproduces and becomes an object of desire for its precious "honey", as the peasants call the latex that oozes from its fruit. This same plant that has been admired for its beauty suddenly transforms and begins to be called “the cursed flower” (La flor maldita). Strangely, after its flower fades, the capsule emerges as a sign of a fortune that needs to be revealed. In a photograph by a Colombian artist Juan Fernando Herrán from 2000, we see the precise moment when the head of the poppy has been delicately cut off, and liquid surges from it. In this art piece, the presence of the plant is transformed into a powerful image that distances itself from certain previous visualities; on the contrary, the photograph shows the opium poppy capsule as a question between the human and the vegetal, the visual and the sensorial, the material and the spiritual.

## Policing, Farmers, Eradication

I will never forget the image of my mother, overwhelmed when she had to unearth the poppy plants in her garden. This constant fear spread throughout the homes of peasants and indigenous peoples, because during the 1990s, they did most of the opium planting, in remote places and on small farms. In the same decade, the Colombian government signed with the United States the "Plan Colombia", a political and economic initiative whose mission was to eradicate illicit crops such as cocaine, marijuana and opium poppy from the country. The exponential increase in poppy cultivation put the country at the top of the world's poppy producers and Colombian heroin became sought after in the foreign market due to its high purity level. In this scenario, the government began a campaign of strong police persecution of both the plant and the people who cultivated it. The eradication was done through the work of many people who dug it up manually and, on the other hand, an intense and ineffective aerial eradication with glyphosate, a potent herbicide. 

In this state of emergency, the police and the military went after the plant and arrested whoever they oversaw taking care of it. Uncertainty and paranoia seemed to be in the air all the time. My mother was right to do away with her collection of red opium poppies. The government created a battleground that translated into a metaphor for a vigilante state. Juan Fernando Herrán himself, in his series "papaver sonmiferum", presents a work entitled "judicial triptych" (tríptico judicial) that evidences this police practice around the plant. In this "installation" he appropriates a photograph that circulated during those years in one of the most important newspapers in Bogota. The image in the center shows two peasants who have been caught. In this case, as it happens with a certain visuality as a police device, the offenders are presented with what they have been arrested for. A table with a delicate tablecloth displays, almost stretching from side to side, a large bouquet of opium poppies. On one side of the table, almost imperceptibly, we can see two blades and two containers can be seen, proof that the two men are guilty even before their trial. 
<param ve-image url="tripticojudicial.jpg">

This delicate staging is doubly displayed by the artist who adds two "natural" capsules, one on each side of the image. The two works, both the photograph and the capsules, are manipulated; the artist himself carefully composes the scene and places these two capsules as two portraits that dialogue with the photograph, almost like a traditional triptych in which each of the parts composes a story. The artist himself conceives the scratching action on each of the capsules as the inscription of a "promise": That promise that comes from the plant itself. It is a promise that is to come and at the same time that is being cut off. The plant itself is a promise of a better future for certain impoverished communities, but it quickly becomes in its opposite as a sign of deception, an injustice, and displacement.

## Displacement, New Landscape, Agencies

The displacement of peasants and indigenous people was considerably accentuated during the war against the "cursed flower". Entire populations had to flee due to police persecution and the structures of the drug production; for some scholars, displacement should not be understood as an effect but as a weapon of war, a capitalist strategy of accumulation in which both the state and the insurgent groups empty land as a reason to expropriate, to appropriate both the territories and their resources. The truth is that, in these politics of domination, the whole landscape was being transformed. Not only was violence being wrought on the human, but also on the plant and the other organisms that coexisted with the opium poppy. The aerial spraying fell from the air and reached every corner of the surface. Those Edenic scenes of an almost virginal landscape of the mountains began to change into a codified space where the machine with its noise and its poison began to become an integral part of that new colonizing gaze. 

Carlos Uribe's (1999) work entitled Horizons with Glyphosate (Horizonte con glifosato) makes direct reference to these political and environmental issues that were amid a broad public and private debate about the increasingly notorious presence of drug money in Colombian society. The work is a quotation and an extension of a 1913 painting of the same name made by Antonio Cano, already considered emblematic for regional visuality in Colombia.  On the one hand, Cano shows a peasant family extending their hand in an act of promise in front of the immensity of a territory that as an act of creation needs to be occupied. The religious, patriarchal and dominion over the territory allusions made the work an unsurpassable example of a certain identity that was beginning to be defined and defended in the region of Antioquia in Colombia, one of the most prosperous and richest regions of the country and at the same time one of the most violent and most marked by drug trafficking. On the other hand, in Uribe's work, in addition to making an artistic appropriation, he also makes a historical reference to an environmental situation that was happening once the airplanes spilled glyphosate.

Curiously, the eyes of the pilots had to direct their gazes to the beauty of the opium poppy flower. Wherever they saw red, they had to spray. The plant becomes a translatable sign of its own precariousness and a threat to the vegetation that covers or hides it. Different reports from both the state and organizations warned of the consequences of aerial spraying for both humans and the environment. Artist Maria Elvira Escallon displays the encounter between landscape and herbicide. For 26 days she takes pictures to demonstrate visually the slow and damaging effect of the glyphosate. The art pieces reveal how the opium poppy relates into a small and big scale. The two works of art, both Uribe's and Escallón's, question the relationship that the plant has with the construction of life and of death, with the intimate, the public and the private. The opium poppy becomes an allegory and accumulation of that which is criminal and immoral. Even today we cannot consider the history of Colombia without understanding the agency of these plants, including the opium poppy, and their relationship with the environment, the animals, and the human.
