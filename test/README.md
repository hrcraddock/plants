## Prehistoric-16th Century
Though the use of opium rapidly spread during the 15th and 16th centuries, opium poppies weren’t always able to live and thrive in just any environments. Poppies, like most other plants known today, were domesticated and coevolved to meet the needs of human beings. It is not known where poppies are native, as the first mention of poppies were as cultivated plants. In the 16th century, opium poppies could be found in books about “hardy flowers” or existing in “wild gardens.” Author and practicing gardener William Robinson described Papaver somniferum as able to “grow[ing] in any soil.” However, the spread of the poppy itself needed careful monitoring via human intervention in order to naturalize and exist in differing environments, specifically outside of the Mediterranean temperate zones.

## 19th Century: A Household Drug 

The nineteenth century saw a conflict between existing conceptions of the opium poppy as a plant of beauty which provided relief and inspiration and increasingly negative attitudes towards the morality of the trade and use of the drug. Nineteenth century herbals such as Köhler's Medizinal-Pflanzen (1890) continued to categorize the opium poppy as a medicinal plant. Often referred to during this period as laudanum, a tincture of opium with wine or water, the relieving effects of opium in medical terms remained well-known and opium was used in commonplace medicines, even for children, to the extent that it was referred to as ‘the poor child’s nurse’ due to its ability to stop babies crying.

## War and Colonialism

The Opium Wars (1839-1841 and 1856-1860) situate the opium poppy within the political conflicts of empire, trade, and regulation in the nineteenth century. Connecting the opium poppy to another primary economic plant of the period, tea, the trade imbalance between Britain and China, with China accepting only silver in exchange for tea, formed the conflict which led to the opium wars. The British response was to illegally smuggle Indian opium into China for payment in silver. Fraught discussions of the ‘Opium Question’ centered on the morality of the trade in light of the addictive properties of the drug, as well as the financial dependence on opium. An 1882 edition of the Journal of the Society of Arts records a discussion of this: ‘there was a very painful impression on the minds of some persons as to the morality of this trade [...] many believed that this country [Britain] was not only importing on a large scale a pernicious drug into the most populous country of the world, but also compelling its introduction and use by force of arms.’

This question of morality was heightened by the use of British India to fuel this drug trade. The East India Company managed opium poppy plantations across India, but sold off the product in to private merchants to transport to China, increasingly disconnecting the opium poppy plant from the drug product it provided. The cultivation of poppies in the nineteenth matches the development of vast global networks of plant transfers, and archival records at Kew describe affiliated experimental plots growing opium poppies in India. These ‘Experimental Poppy Gardens’ sought to examine methods of poppy cultivation, including diseases and soil conditions impacting the plants and the yield of opium they produced. The opium poppy was considered a ‘useful plant’, and a whole volume in the Miscellaneous Reports of Kew is dedicated to it: ‘India: Economic Products: Opium’. This categorisation as an ‘economic product’ and the regulation of opium poppy cultivation by the East India Company situates the plant within the context of colonial economic botany in the nineteenth century; as a plant which produced a product of economic value, the opium poppy is given attention in this collection which records the work of colonial botany in Kew’s network of gardens across the British Empire. Joseph Hooker, later director of Kew Gardens between 1865 and 1885, visited the opium manufactory in <span data-mouseover-map-flyto="25.599042067145163, 85.13514345584765", 10">Patna</span> in India in 1848 and returned with a series of illustrations displaying the processes of cultivating and manufacturing opium. He gives an account of the process of cultivation and labour intensive methods of extraction, from the granting of licenses from the East India Company, the flowering of the poppies in late January and early February, the extraction of latex from the seed pods in February and March, the transportation of the opium jars to stores, and the creation of ‘balls’ of opium by men working ‘ten hours a day’ to be sent to market.
