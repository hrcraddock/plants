## Prehistoric-16th Century
Though the use of opium rapidly spread during the 15th and 16th centuries, opium poppies weren’t always able to live and thrive in just any environments. Poppies, like most other plants known today, were domesticated and coevolved to meet the needs of human beings. It is not known where poppies are native, as the first mention of poppies were as cultivated plants. In the 16th century, opium poppies could be found in books about “hardy flowers” or existing in “wild gardens.” Author and practicing gardener William Robinson described Papaver somniferum as able to “grow[ing] in any soil.” However, the spread of the poppy itself needed careful monitoring via human intervention in order to naturalize and exist in differing environments, specifically outside of the Mediterranean temperate zones.

## 19th Century: A Household Drug 

The nineteenth century saw a conflict between existing conceptions of the opium poppy as a plant of beauty which provided relief and inspiration and increasingly negative attitudes towards the morality of the trade and use of the drug. Nineteenth century herbals such as Köhler's Medizinal-Pflanzen (1890) continued to categorize the opium poppy as a medicinal plant. Often referred to during this period as laudanum, a tincture of opium with wine or water, the relieving effects of opium in medical terms remained well-known and opium was used in commonplace medicines, even for children, to the extent that it was referred to as ‘the poor child’s nurse’ due to its ability to stop babies crying.

## Map

Joseph Hooker, later director of Kew Gardens between 1865 and 1885, visited the opium manufactory in Patna in India in 1848 and returned with a series of illustrations displaying the processes of cultivating and manufacturing opium. The East India Company managed opium poppy plantations across India, but sold off the product in <span data-mouseover-map-flyto="22.73466141131803, 88.3571440124626, 10">Calcutta</span> to private merchants to transport to China, increasingly disconnecting the opium poppy plant from the drug product it provided.
